## Installation

For client side installation, just run the jar file.
Either by double-clicking on it, or running `java -jar FoxLoader.jar`

To run FoxLoader as a server just run `java -jar FoxLoader.jar --server`

Note: For PojavLauncher, click on "Install .jar" and the rest should be automatic,
only the Android version of PojavLauncher is supported.

## Documentation

For mixins usage check here: https://github.com/2xsaiko/mixin-cheatsheet

For spark usage check here: https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Command-Usage

For example mod check here: https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxLoaderExampleMod

## Project structure
- `betacraft` -> BetaCraft launch method to run fox loader
- `client` -> client specific code
- `common` -> main component of the mod loader that are shared both on client and on server
- `dev` -> Gradle plugin
- `final` -> Installer a format in which the mod loader is shipped to user
- `server` -> server specific code

## Boot process

- Load pre patches
- Load core-mods (Aka. Legacy mods) into class loader
- Load pre-patches (FoxLoader asm patches)
- Load mods into class loader
- Do full game pre-patching
- Initialize mixins
- Allow game to be loaded
- Load mods
- Launch game

As you see the game is allowed to be loaded very late into the boot process, even after mixins.

This ensures that all patches introduced by mods are applied, 
but also prevent code loaded in MixinPlugins to load Minecraft classes,
please keep that in mind when messing with mixins plugins.

## Lua mods

If you are too lazy to learn java you can just use put `.lua` files in your `mods` folder,
while the lua API is a lot more limited than the java one, it should be enough to allow 
you to customize your server to your likings without putting too much effort.

```lua
-- modId: lua_example
-- modName: Lua Example Mod
-- version: 1.0.0
-- description: Just add /discord to the game.
--

print("Hello from lua")

gameRegistry.registerCommand(function(args, player)
    player:displayChatMessage(chatColors.AQUA .. "https://discord.gg/38Vfes6NpR")
end, "discord", false) -- false is needed cause it default to "opOnly = true"

mod.onNetworkPlayerJoined = function(player)
    player:displayChatMessage(chatColors.AQUA .. "Welcome back to server name!")
end
```

Note: You can also use the [`luajava`](https://github.com/luaj/luaj#user-content-luajava) extension from [LuaJ](https://github.com/luaj/luaj)
